1: Caesar Cipher

From Wikipedia:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

2: Sub strings

From Odin: 

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

3: Stock Picker

The program takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day and returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.

4: Bubble Sort

This program takes an array and returns sorted array using bubble method (more in Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
